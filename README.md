# CuencAFSK
Some signal processing experiments to decode a unknown radio signal that looks like a variant of the popular [AFSK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying#Audio_frequency-shift_keying) modulation scheme following the [ITU V.23 mode 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU_V.23) standard.
This signal was being broadcast from [40.081254, -2.127801](https://goo.gl/maps/4g8DD67JDHToWbUr5), and you can even hear a faint chirp from the audio demodulation without any tool, probably due to an on-premises loudspeaker.
